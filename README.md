## What

Magical ball of excuses is a side project website from the design of [Michael Crawford](https://dribbble.com/michaelccraw) : ["Magical ball of excuses"](https://dribbble.com/shots/15715973-Magical-Ball-of-Excuses). It's a short interactive and funny website to find random excuse for canceling plans.

## Why

The design and challenge for the front-end integration really inspired me.

## How

Based on a NextJS starter project, I used styled-components and framer-motion for the styling.

Dependencies :

- framer
- framer-motion
- styled-components
- polished
